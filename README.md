# Crypto Policies Check

This small utility was stolen from [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62841553/how-can-i-configure-java-cryptography-extension-jce-in-openjdk-11) and is used to determine if the Crypto policies are enabled and whether configured for restricted or unlimited policies.

## Execution

To execute, first compile the class with `javac CryptoPoliciesCheck.java` and then run it with `java CryptoPoliciesCheck`.
